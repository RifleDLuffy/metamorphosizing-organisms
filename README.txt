Move responsibilty of abilitiy activation and ability implementation from Game to the Organism class.
Maybe even get rid of the Ability class.
Have an abstract organim class that all of the organisms inherit from.
Print the mana cost next to the abilities when the players are selecting organisms
Create an abstract class drawable with the abstract method draw.
Make game, player and organism children of this class.

EVERYTHING ABOVE HAS BEEN DONE
